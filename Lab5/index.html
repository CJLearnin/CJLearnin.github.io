    <h1>INST 377</h1>
    <p>
      This repo contains the harsh realitys of growing up on the west side of
      Philly. As a yonugster I had many issues, such as chilling out realxing
      all cool playing b ball outside the school. When a couple of guys, who
      were up to no good. Started making trouble in my neighborhood. I got into
      one lil scuffle and my mom got beffudled. She said 'You're movin' with
      your auntie and uncle in Maryland' I begged and pleaded with her day after
      day But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way.... I whisteled for
      a cab and when it came near. The license plate said INST 377 and it had
      Javascript in the mirror If anything I could say that this cab was toxic
      But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, homes to Hornbake' Thats how this
      repo got created. Thanks for reading =)
