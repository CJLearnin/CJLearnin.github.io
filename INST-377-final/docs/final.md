<h1>Final Report (docs/final.md)</h1> 

<h2> Introduction </h2>

The Dynamic Web Applications class at the University of Maryland in Fall 2019, was tasked with solving an information problem in Prince Geoge’s County Maryland. Our team decided to create a one-stop hub website where residents in the county could find all their local farmers’ markets by using the SODA API supplied on Prince George’s County Open Data. The creators of the website and tacklers of the information problem are Clarence Fernandes, Hilary Zhang, Yeeun Kang, Rohan Saxena, Janell Coleman, and Neel Shah. The curated website can be found at the following URL: Compassionate-kepler-215836.netlify.com Each team member had a unique role in the final reveal of the website as the roles ranged from technical to non-technical roles. This report gives an overview of the final product, explains the team’s process in creating the site, and offers recommendations on how the final product could be built upon and improved in the future. 
 
 <h2> Information Problem </h2>
 
The team desired to solve the information problem surrounding farmers’ markets in Prince George’s County, Maryland for significant reasons. There are numerous farmers’ markets located throughout the county, but there is not a resource available that offers information about each market on one website and gives the demographic breakdown of the county that supports why it's important to bring awareness to the farmers’ markets. Prince George’s County demographic is composed of mostly minorities. Because of this, the team wants to promote healthy and fresh foods located in the county. While the website does not solve the other problems revolving around food insecurity and unhealthy eating habits such as low-income, lack of transportation, and a lack of knowledge, it is our goal that the website will make people aware of the fresh food options located in the county and potentially increase the number of fresh foods people and visitors of the county consume. 
 
 <h2> Target Audience </h2>
 
The target audience of this website is residents and visitors of  PG county that want to explore the different farmer’s markets. Prince George’s County Farmers Market website offers more than a traditional Google search as the content is made specifically for people in PG county and serves as a single source of information.  We aim to promote healthy food options located in the county to the residents and visitors of the county. Additionally, our stakeholders are vendors at the farmers market as they will receive a direct promotion to potential customers from our site. In addition to promoting healthy foods, our site promotes some of the small businesses in the county. This website is unique as it is specifically for a small suburb in Maryland. 
 
 
<h2>Technical System</h2>  

To solve the information problem, our team utilized the technical system of a Google Map on the website. Through the map, users will have different options to choose from. On the live Google Map, users can select a farmers market to view the farmers market’s name, address, and website. The live Google Map is useful for the users that want to visually see where the specific farmers’ markets are located. 
 
Along with the Google Map, users can see the list of farmer’s markets organized in a table on the Service tab. This list has the names of different farmer’s markets and the clickable links where users can access their websites. Overall, the technical system our team developed provides the users with an efficient way to find the available farmer’s markets in PG County. Moreover, this system will support the local businesses in PG County promoting them and bringing awareness to the fresh foods that are available in the county.
 
One of the challenges our team had during developing the project was adding a filtering feature on the website. We wanted to develop the filtering option so users had the ability to filter information about the farmer’s markets based on the seasons the markets are open, the products they offer, and the average customer reviews. However, developing this feature is complex for the scope of the initial project, so we put more effort into the live Google Map system.

 
<h2>Future Recommendations</h2> 

The Prince Georges County Farmers Market website is a solid foundation for bringing awareness to the healthy foods located in Prince George's County while promoting small businesses. The strong foundation built from this website allows for numerous projects to be built off of what we started. Going forward, it is recommended that developers add a filtering feature to the website. Filtering will allow users to find out what products the farmer’s markets offer if they accept government food assistance payment, and what seasons the markets are open. This will give users an abundance of information to help users make decisions about which farmers market is appropriate for them. Our team has laid the foundation for this project and future developers can take it to the next level to ensure the website meets its full potential and serves its goal.
