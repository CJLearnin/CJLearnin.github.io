<h2>Description of the Project</h2>  
	Our application is named Farmers Markets in Prince George’s County, Maryland. The website organizes, presents, and delivers information about local farmer’s markets in PG County for residents that are interested in going to a farmers market to get fresh foods. Some farmers’ markets do not effectively communicate with the public and have limited updates on their webpage. Our group decided to solve this information problem by providing information about all farmers’ markets in the county on one website.  
The team gathered resources from PG County’s Open Data API on farmers’ markets and pulled the information from the API to display farmers markets’ locations with a live Google Map. The application comes equipped with a home page, an about page, a service page, and a help page. Users will be welcomed with a home page when they first enter our website. On the home page, users will get a brief description of the goal of the website. The about page tells users more about our application and the services we provide. The service page, where the main action takes place, is composed of the list of farmer’s markets, their websites, and their Google Map location. While our application is intuitive, easy-to-use,  and has passed usability tests, we offer users instructions on how to use our application on the help page. The application is optimized for all the popular desktop browsers, including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, IE, Safari, and mobile browsers, such as Android browsers and iOS Safari. Below, are the links to access our site and key manuals.
